## MTLExtraction
This algorithm creates models of 3D molds with slits guiding the cutting to extract the medial temporal lobe of an hemisphere. The first 3D printed mold is designed to hold the whole hemisphere, guiding cuts orthogonal to the midsagittal plane. The second mold is designed to hold the extracted tissue block, guiding subsequent longitudinal cuts.
Cuts can be manually positioned or automatically using Powell's method. In the latter case, the algorithm finds 6 cuts to trim the tissue to fit into a 50mm cylindrical holder.
